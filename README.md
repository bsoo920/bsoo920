My name is **Bright Soo**.  And below are...
## my Noteworthy Repos ðŸ˜€ ##
1. [**playgrounds-battleship**](https://github.com/bsoo920/playgrounds-battleship) is my solution to a Swift Playground challenge that outperforms Apple's best pre-loaded solution by 11% while having 28% fewer lines of code.

1. [**codepath**](https://github.com/bsoo920/codepath) was my first non-trivial effort to do some iOS programming and was my answer to a [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) challenge.  The feature I'm most proud of is the set of sliders that automatically enforce non-decreasing order, and that the number of sliders can be easily supported with [minimal code change](https://github.com/bsoo920/codepath/blob/436610feaf3d2dd2745f00ed45d390bb7ece45d3/tippy/SettingsViewController.swift#L162):

1. _"[**How safe is your car**](https://github.com/bsoo920/gatech-how-safe-is-your-car), especially when compared to other similar vehicles?"_ is the question that I wanted to answer by leading a class project with a team of 4 in a [Data & Visual Analytics graduate class](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6242-data-visual-analytics) at GeorgiaTech.  I conceived and architected the project, and wrote the majority of the python code (see [commits](https://github.com/bsoo920/gatech-how-safe-is-your-car/commits/main)).
