## My Noteworthy Repos ðŸ˜€ ##
1. [**playgrounds-battleship**](https://github.com/bsoo920/playgrounds-battleship) is my solution to a Swift Playground challenge that beats the best of Apple's pre-loaded solutions while having fewer lines of code.

1. [**codepath**](https://github.com/bsoo920/codepath) was my first non-trivial effort to do some iOS programming and was my answer to a [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) challenge.  The feature I'm most proud of is the set of sliders that automatically enforce non-decreasing order, and that the number of sliders can be easily supported with [minimal coding](https://github.com/bsoo920/codepath/blob/436610feaf3d2dd2745f00ed45d390bb7ece45d3/tippy/SettingsViewController.swift#L162):
